# kolektivo-curacao-geonft-weatherstations
This repository contains building blocks for the off-chain to on-chain weather station data feed. The 'Virtual Environment' file consists of code that creates a virtual environment which is very much needed to request from API

The 'PWS API Current observations' file retrieves the daily observations from Wunderground, writes that data to CSV and uploads it daily to IPFS.
